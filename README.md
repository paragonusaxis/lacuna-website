# lacuna-website
Lacuna is the result of a group assignment made for College. It's an experimental magazine with the purpose of promoting independent artists from the city of Bauru, Brazil. 

I was responsible for coding the website. This is my first personal project of this type and also the first time I tried to utilize CSS more seriously. 

This website was made using pure CSS and JQuery.
